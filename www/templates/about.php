                <hr>
                <p>Aaron started Integrity Clean as a form of part time employment, to enable him to be more involved in study and other pursuits. He soon became aware that there was a real need for honest commercial cleaners, who could use their initiative and consistently leave buildings clean and tidy. Aaron soon employed some of his family then eventually other staff.
