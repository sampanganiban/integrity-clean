                    <p>We use BIODEGRADABLE products and the correct amounts of dilution, which is often overlooked in caring for the environment.</p>
                    <p>SEPARATE EQUIPMENT is reserved for the cleaning of toilet areas and rubber gloves are worn.</p>
                    <p>WE DO NOT CARRY TOILET BRUSHES AROUND. This means there is no chance of contaminated water dripping onto surfaces and other areas, outside the toilet area. All toilets we clean must have their own toilet brushes.</p>
                    <p>We use YOUR DISHCLOTH IN YOUR CAFETERIA â€“ not some stray cleaning cloth.</p>

                    <p>We call security to say we are on site - if required. We clean toilets, showers, restock consumables, wash our hands then clean kitchens, do dishes, remove rubbish, replace bin liners, dust, vacuum, clean window and mop. Then last but by no means least we set the alarms, turn off your lights and lock up.</p>

                    <h3>TRADITIONAL FLOOR WAXING SERVICE</h3>
                    <p>Our top end traditional floor waxing service is for hardwood floors. Often hardwood floors are the centre of attention in a reception area or even in a home. As it's a <strong>natural product</strong> (bees wax), it requires a little more maintenance than other polishes. However, if you want the great smell that comes from a freshly waxed floor, and that warmth and swirly sheen, then it's worth the extra cost.</p>
